A radiotracer is usually a target compound that is labelled with a radioactive isotope. In this reposiroty are code for use in PET research. In particular, some of the programs include
* Conversion from binary to text
* NEMA standards implemented in Imagej
* Visualization of data

Read through the *data description* file to  understand the format of the binary file. Not specifically point 5. The program parser_binary_to_text.py  is used to convert the data from binary to text and then visualized using various jupyter notbooks
